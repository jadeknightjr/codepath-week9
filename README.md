## Which Honeypot(s) you deployed
I deployed only one honeypot called  Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP .

## Any issues you encountered
Hurricane Labs no longer hosts the pyev.git repo. I had to change the hoster. Furthermore, I had to open port 80 on the google cloud platform.

## A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.
I recieved 26 attacks as of righting this readme. However, the number keeps increasing and it will no doubt increase the longer it's up. Most of these attacks appear to be of North American, European, and Asian countries.

## Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected
Not alot of information about the attacks are revealed to us. Furthermore, I never advertised this site so how are these attackers very quickly attacking me.
